Requires:
1. Powershell 5.1 (Windows)
2. Pester 4.x+

Instructions:
1. Make as many of the existing unit tests pass by fixing the code under test -- *not the tests*
2. *Do not worry* about scores or "the right answers".
3. Do *not* change the unit tests inside `tests/`. Fix the functions inside `sut/` unless comments specify otherwise.
4. *Make comments* on both tests you fix and ones you can't. What is important is your reasoning.
